# Personal Website Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project serves as a playground for me to get more familiar with HTML and CSS. As I learn and grow in my understanding of web development, I will continue to update and improve this site.

## Project Status

This website is very much a living document. It is neither perfect nor finished at the moment. As I learn more about web design and development, I plan to implement new features, refine the layout, and improve the overall user experience.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

-   To build a personal website from scratch using only HTML and CSS.
-   To practice and improve my web development skills.
-   To experiment with different design ideas and coding techniques.

## Contributions

While this is a personal project for educational purposes, I am open to suggestions and contributions. If you have any ideas or notice any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Feedback

Feedback is always very welcome. If you have any to offer, please reach out to me through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/issues), pull requests or the socials linked on this website.
